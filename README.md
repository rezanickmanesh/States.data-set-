# States.data-set-


Exercise 0: least squares regression

Use the states.rds data set. Fit a model predicting energy consumed per capita (energy) from the percentage of residents living in metropolitan areas (metro). Be sure to

1. Examine/plot the data before fitting the model
2. Print and interpret the model summary
3. plot the model to look for deviations from modeling assumptions
4. Select one or more additional predictors to add to your model and repeat steps 1-3. Is this model significantly better than the model with metro as the only predictor?

Exercise 1: interactions and factors

Use the states data set.

1. Add on to the regression equation that you created in exercise 1 by generating an interaction term and testing the interaction.
2. Try adding region to the model. Are there significant differences across the four regions?
